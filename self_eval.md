if certain criteria need to be met for a given variable
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
figure out how to ask the user to input the variable value
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Being able to find a solution if a problem came up in little time feels good.  Makes me feel like my brain is adapting to this way of thinking.
